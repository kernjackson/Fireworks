# Fireworks

This code is adapted from this article [Blooming fireworks with Metal and SwiftUI](https://uvolchyk.medium.com/blooming-fireworks-with-metal-and-swiftui-6550cef997e2) written by [Uladzislau Volchyk](https://uvolchyk.medium.com). I highly suggest reading it if you want to understand how the metal shader works.

My primary contribution is making it interactive. You can tap or click the view to add up to 10 simultaneous fireworks.
